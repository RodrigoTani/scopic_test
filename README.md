# Test Task: Technical QA
## Description:
You were given a task to cover a web application with automated tests (AT) in order to
determine possible bugs and have a way to do quick regression/integration testing in the
future. We would like you to demonstrate how you would do this by completing the following
tasks:

1. Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/
a) Create automated test cases for login/registration and 1 major end-to-end scenario;
2. Reqres: https://reqres.in/
a) Cover CRUD operations for one REST endpoint defined in reqres.in;
b) Cover scenarios which contain usage of several endpoints;
3. Test Cases and bugs
a) Define 2 test cases. You can choose any from the tasks above.
b) Define 2 bugs with priority critical or higher. You can choose any from the tasks above.
4. Documentation
a) A short description of the approach you would use for AT for the first 2 tasks. The
description should clarify things like:
• What tools / frameworks would you use for AT?
• What would be used for each tool?
• What parts of the app you would apply AT to?
• Anything else you want to mention.
Note: The estimated time for the tasks 6-8 hours
